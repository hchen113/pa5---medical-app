CS 441 - Meal Tracker for Patients with IBD

The purpose of this app is to help patients with Irritable Bowel Disease such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crhon's Disease help keep track of the history of food intake and timeframe between flare ups.

As someone with Ulcerative Colitis, I've been told that there is a ccorrelation between which foods I eat and when i experiance a flare up. I have very short term memory and often can't remember what I eat the previous day. This app emphasizes the meal (eg: breakfest, lunch, dinner, and or snack), meal name (eg: spagetti), and most importantly, the key ingredients of the dish. Of course, its effectiveness ultmiately depends how detailed and diligent the patient is with capturing the details of their daily intake.


A huge part of the app is building upon the Apple documentation and Apple sample TableView App and UI from their developers website.
